For example, should it automatically unlock doors or turnstiles for authorized personnel, or simply trigger an alert?\n5.  **Alerts & Reporting:** What kind of alerts or notifications are needed when an unauthorized person is detected (e.g., email to security, on-screen alert, audible alarm)?

Are there any specific weather conditions (rain, snow, extreme temperatures) that the system needs to withstand? Will the system need to operate 24/7, or during specific hours?\n4.  **Alert alarm:** Regarding the alert alarm, what kind of alarm mechanism are you envisioning (e.g., audible siren, visual flashing lights, notification to security personnel via SMS/email, integration with a central security system)?

If it\'s a direct integration, what database technology is in use?\n4.  **Volume & Latency**: The estimated volume is 50 resumes per day. Is this an average daily volume, or a peak volume?
